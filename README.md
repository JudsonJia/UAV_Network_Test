# UAV_Network_Test

This is the GitHub repository of the paper "Network-Aware Performance Evaluation for Low-Altitude UAV Systems". All the result codes of the flight tests are stored in detail here and can be found in the results folder.

Our hardware-validated results address critical gaps in UAV simulation platform development by demonstrating that simulation platforms must model specific control architecture characteristics rather than applying universal bandwidth thresholds across different micro-UAV platforms.   The finding that mathematical equivalence does not equal operational equivalence emphasizes the importance of hardware validation over theoretical analysis alone.   Command timing modeling must account for arrival patterns, not just aggregate rates, and threshold validation benchmarks are platform-specific and must be adapted for different UAV architectures.
